# A document aimed at creating creating a functioning gui for my game.

"""NEXT STEPS:

FIRST:
I need to work on connecting the Pushbuttons to items.


NEXT:
I need to then start combining the Gui to their
respective variables and methods.

AFTER THIS: <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< THIS
I had an idea that could help my code.
The game rounds increase every time GO is pressed,
AND when an option is selected.
The first options at the start of the game include the
guide text, and the play option. After this, when GO and an Option has been pressed,
the question will change and the round_number variable will increase by 1."""

"""OK NEW PLAN NOW.
SO THE CODE WORKS, IT CAN FIND THE CORRECT ANSWER IN THE QUESTIONS.
HOWEVER, WE ALSO FOUND THAT IT DOESN'T RESET THE QUESTION, BUT NOT JUST THAT
I REALISED THAT IT WON'T FIND THE QUESTION SPINNER. I NEED TO CREATE A FUNCTION THAT
CLEARS EVERYTHING AND RESETS ALL THE GUI. NEED TO PLAN HOW TO DO THIS.
PLAN A: USE THE ROUND NUMBER VARIABLE, WHENEVER THAT CHANGES A FUNCTION OR LOOP RUNS THROUGH THE STUFF,
RESETTING EVERYTHING.
PLAN B: JUST PUT ALL OF MY GUI STUFF INTO A FUNCTION THAT RUNS EVERY TIME I CALL IT
(COULD PUT THIS INTO A NEW DOCUMENT TOO FOR CLEANLINESS). JUST NEED IT CALLED AT THE START.

IN RETROSPECT I FEEL LIKE PLAN A IS MORE COMPLICATED. PLAN B IS SIMPLER I FEEL. LETS TRY IT."""
